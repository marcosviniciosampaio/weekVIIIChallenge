RESTful API
First I began to plan the API design based on the last challenge. Then I've created the model package to make the entities (student, classroom, scrum master, coordinator, instructor and squad), 
the package repository to store the respective data, the package dto to control the input's and output's of the data, the package service to implement the bussiness rules and the controller to make the requests and responses.
After finished the CRUD for all of those entities, I began to think about how could I make the relationships between them. I've made a lot of tries since then, but not even one was succesfull, then I asked for help to members 
of my squad and for Fabio, they helped me a lot, but again, I couldn't make it work. I made three branches (main, development and relationships), where the main is for the final version, the development is for the development of 
the CRUD and relationship is for build the relationships between the entities. Sadly, I had to merge the development into the main, because I couldn't make the relationships, neither the tests or the SQL script, because I am
stuck on the relationships. I'm sorry for not was able to make all the requirements of the project, I'm planning to re-study the last weeks to see if I can understand better and don't disappoint again.
